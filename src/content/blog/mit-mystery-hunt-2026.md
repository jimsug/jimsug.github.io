I think I'll be pretty brief, since I don't really have a lot to say (which is mostly a good thing!) about the hunt that was:

- Loved the theme. As a '90s kid, <strike>Pokemon</strike> Puzzmon is a callback full of feels.
- Wish I'd spent a little more time on puzzles. But really, it was pretty good? I spent _slightly_ more time writing a way for us to manage unlockable puzzles than I think I ended up wanting to, but solving that problem ended up being pretty straightforward in a way that solving some puzzles weren't.

Some of the puzzles I worked on and enjoyed:
- **Filial Pie Tree**: A fun puzzle that I didn't end up seeing through to the very end, but tickled some of my university knowledge.
- **Art quests**: This casino round involved some really fun art identification that tested my ability to tell art from... well, art
- **MIT Dropquotes**: Love me a good dropquote.
- **Data Revisualization**: I didn't get the solve on this, do I need to hand in my badge?
- **Clue Arbiter**: Another callback! Loved it.

Keen to see what Providence do next year!
