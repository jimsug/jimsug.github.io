So, I'm reviving the blog! I think I do want a place to put thought sporadically, and this is going to be it.

Some things that have been on my mind:

- **[Makeover Monday](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/)**. I've been *intending* to do this for a while, but for reasons of procrastination and perhaps a lack of inspiration, I haven't gotten started yet. I _do_ want to, though!
- **A _super-easy_ gender pay gap calculator**. Does this already exist? I think this probably requires some ground work on what the gender pay gap is, whether it exists, and who should care, before I can really jump into how to calculate it for your company.
- **Puzzlehunt collaboration software**. If you've read my about page, or know me, you'll know that I solve puzzles recreationally, and I've done some work on [Jolly Roger](https://github.com/jimsug/jolly-roger). I think I have some ideas simmering away in the back of my head constantly, so I want to trickle some of thos into reality eventually.
